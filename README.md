# Hi, I’m Ayush 👋

I’m learning to build real-world web applications by focusing on **building first**.

### What I’m working on
- Admin dashboards & SaaS-style applications
- Learning by building small, real features step by step

### Tech I’m using
- React
- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript
- PostgreSQL (learning)
- Prisma (learning)

### My approach
- Build first, learn what blocks me
- No tutorial hopping
- Small progress every day

I’m documenting my journey through real projects here on GitHub.
